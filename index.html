        I am a Web Editor for Leidos - the prime contractor for the National Science Foundation's United States
        Antarctic Program (USAP), so I get to support science in Antarctica on a daily basis. I am responsible for
        managing and maintaining content on our three station intranets as well as the public-facing
        site <a href="https://www.usap.gov/" target="_blank">USAP.gov</a>.
      </p>

        I have been with the program since June 2016. My first rather large task involved traveling to South Pole
        Station to roll out the new intranet for station personnel. The timing around this allowed me to spend my
        24th birthday at the bottom of the world; I think that's pretty cool.

        I have a Bachelor of Science degree in English - Professional Writing with a minor in Human Computer
        Interaction/User Experience (HCI/UX) from the University of North Alabama (UNA). Prior to recieving my
        bachelor's degree, I graduated from Calhoun Community College with an Associate of Applied Science degree in
        Business Administration - Paralegal Studies.
